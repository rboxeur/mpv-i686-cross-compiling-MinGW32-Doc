=====

This repository contains my own documentation to cross-compil MPV Player
(<https://mpv.io/>) on Linux 32Bits using

-   GCC 7.2.0
-   MinGW-w64 5.0.4
-   Bin-utils 2.29.1

I tried to follow steps from https://github.com/qyot27/mpv/blob/extra-new/DOCS/crosscompile-mingw-tedious.txt by adding additional packages (crossc, shaderc, angleproject, vulkan-sdk ...)

Cross-compiling is done a pure native Linux 32 Bits machine

-   Kernel: 4.8.17
-   CPU: Intel Core i5-4430 CPU @ 3.2GHz
-   GPU: AMD/ATI Hawaii XT [Radeon R9 290X]
-   RAM: 1087MB / 8024MB

`index.rst` is the main file of this repository
